## What is Grocery Data Analyzer?

Grocery Data Analyzer is a project made for SNHU's CS-210 class. The goal of the project is to take a text file containing data from the purchases made at a grocery store and use, both, C++ and Python to manipulate the data. An underlying goal of the project is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of Python and C++ and to combine their strengths to be able to analyze and manipulate the data in the most effective way possible.

## What did you do particularly well?

By separating all unrelated code, I believe I modularized the code very well.

## Where could you enhance your code?

To make the main() function more readable, I could've put most of the code within it into a separate function.

## Which pieces of the code did you find to be most challenging?

I didn't have very much experience with combining programming languanges going into this project, so I found the code that interfaces between C++ and Python to be somewhat confusing at first. By combing through the documentation and doing small tests here and there, I've come to a much greater understanding of how the code works.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I organized the code into separate functions based on the different concerns of the program, I followed a naming convention and included comments where necessary, and I kept coupling between modules to the absolute minimum.
